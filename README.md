### Can be installed through the Runelite Pluginhub, under the name `Temple Tracker`

- Adds an overlay to the temple trek ui, which shows the points and duration of a temple trek, as well as all encounters, and the duration of each encounter. This data can be logged to a file. 
- Adds menu entry swaps specific temple trekking, such as continue-trek, escort for each companion, and use on the druid pouch.
## Data Storage
