###Features
- Highlighting of the double fishing spot
- Highlighting of the fires, as well as a timer on the fires when they will spread/when they will spawn from the cloud
- Highlighting when the wave will hit on the totem poles/masts from when the wave is first announced, and turning green when you are tethered.
- Showing how much fish in your inventory you need to cook for the boss' energy to go down to 0 (only works in solo's, since the boss has higher hp with more people in the minigame)
